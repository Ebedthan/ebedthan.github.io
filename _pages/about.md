I am a bioinformatician and a biostatistician generally interested in mathematical and statistical modelling of biological process. I love to design fast and efficient algorithms to answer biological questions. I am also a fan of data analysis.

My current works are across metagenomics (mouse, human, soil), genomics (plant viruses, bacteriophages, bacteria), transcriptomics (venom glands), proteomics.
